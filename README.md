Systems icons based on Nintendo Classic Mini Super Nintendo.

Most of these icons were created by Ruckage and Mahare. I ported them and added my own to use with GarlicOS.


I uploaded a template and font for icon description so anyone can create his own icons. Just resize the icons to 123x123 to match the set's size.
